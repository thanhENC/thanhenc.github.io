Karen is no stranger to SFSF. This is her third appearance as guest of
honor. We all love Karen here. She's a great writer and a lot of fun - but
she does take an awful picture! Karen has won two JWC awards, most recently
for her short story, <I>Random Memories</I>. Maybe she'll forget about
that photo...
